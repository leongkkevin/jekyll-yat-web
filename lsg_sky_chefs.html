    From June of 2022, I started at LSG Sky Chefs as an intern, creating training for different departments.
    At the end of the journey, I created this vlog which recapped my first experience in the "airline catering film industry!"

    After that fun summer, I continued to work as a part-time content creator: making content for both training and some events!
    The coolest event I attended was the 2023 LSG Sky Chefs Truck Rodeo, where I traveled to Las Vegas, NV to watch the Rodeo semi-finals.
    To recap my experience, I made this trailer video for the finals in Denver!

    Then it was off to Denver for the 2023 Finals. 
    I got to be an interviewer, cameraman, and editor on this project - and had a blast meeting everyone and being right in the center of the competitive action!
    Then, I made this video to show off the cowboy spirit of the Truck Rodeo Finals!

    I'm continuing to work at LSG Sky Chefs as of present to both support myself, while allowing myself to be creative at work.
    I am looking forward to expanding my resume and portfolio with them!
